                <h1>I'm Fakeha Ansari</h1>
                <p>I am a computer science graduate with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, 
                an aspiring game developer, and a published author. My journey has been a blend of creativity and 
                technical expertise, with experiences ranging from building AI-powered solutions to crafting engaging 
                stories as a young adult novelist. </p>
                <p>Outside of work, I’m a volleyball captain, a runner, and an avid reader, 
                always seeking inspiration both on the court and in the pages of a great book. With a passion for innovation 
                and storytelling, I’m driven to explore new ways to combine technology, creativity, and teamwork in everything I do.

                    <p>
                        I love to read, so I tried my hand at writing! I started this journey when I was fresh out of high school with a rough 
                        storyboard and a dream. I jotted down all possible ideas of how i can get figments of my imagination onto paper, 
                        create them as living breathing beings through words. I spent about two years in writing and planning, going through 
                        countless changes until I was happy with how Riot and Kinza came to be.
                        Today, I am a internationally published author sharing the story of a hobby with the rest of the world!

                        While I was working towards my degree, I had the chance to collaborate with 4 very talented people and 
                        work on this project. In this we designed a semi-steering system based on Internet of Things (IoT) for 
                        better mobility. This was based on object detection 
                        algorthims such as YOLO and OpenVino for detection of objects that may pose a threat to drivers.

                        In my final year of university, I had the privilege to write an article for my university yearly magazine, 
                        Connections. After mentally pacing back and forth on what I could possible write on, I decided on exploring 
                        on creative outlets we use. After all opportunities to unwind in todays age are hard to find and far between. 
                        As such, I wrote about how we infuse parts of our soul and how we perceive others in artistic outlets. 
                        Characters as mirrors discusses and explores how even great authors like Charles dickens infuses his work 
                        with how he sees the world around him.
